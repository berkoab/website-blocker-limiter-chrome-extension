PERMISSIONS EXPLAINED

"Read and change all your data on all websites"
The extension needs to check every website you visit against your blocked 
sites list. This permission is required for the core blocking functionality. 
The extension only reads URLs to compare with your block list - it does not 
read, store, or transmit page content, passwords, form data, or any other 
information.

Storage Permission
Used exclusively to save your settings locally on your device. No data is 
synchronized or backed up to any cloud service.

Tabs Permission
Allows the extension to identify your current tab when you click "Add 
Current Website" and to redirect blocked pages. Does not track or log 
your tabs.

Web Navigation Permission
Intercepts navigation to blocked websites. This is how blocking works - 
the extension checks each navigation event against your local block list.

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
None. This extension does not communicate with any external services, APIs, 
or servers.

UPDATES TO THIS POLICY
We will update this policy if our privacy practices change. Changes will be 
posted at this URL with a new "Last Updated" date.
