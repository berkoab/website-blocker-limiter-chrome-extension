# Website Blocker & Limiter Chrome Extension
Take Control of Your Digital Habits

Website Blocker helps you eliminate distractions and build healthier browsing habits. Whether you need to completely block time-wasting sites or simply limit how long you spend on them each day, this extension gives you the tools to stay focused and productive.

KEY FEATURES

🔒 Full Website Blocking
Block any website completely with password protection. Once blocked, you won't be able to access the site without entering your master password—helping you resist temptation.

⏱️ Daily Time Limits
Don't want to block a site entirely? Set a daily time limit instead (e.g., 30 minutes of social media per day). The extension tracks your usage and blocks access once you hit your limit. Limits reset automatically each day.

🛡️ Password Protection
Set a master password to prevent yourself from removing blocks during moments of weakness. Forgot your password? Recovery is available through security questions.

🎯 Flexible Blocking Options
- Block entire domains (youtube.com blocks all of YouTube)
- Block specific pages (youtube.com/watch?v=xxx blocks just that video)
- Mix full blocks and time limits for different sites
- One-click blocking for your current website

📊 Real-Time Usage Tracking
See how much time you've spent on time-limited websites today and how much time remains.
